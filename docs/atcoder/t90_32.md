```haskell
type I = [[Int]]
type O = Maybe Int

solve :: I -> O
solve ([n]:xs)
    | null iss = Nothing
    | otherwise = Just $ minimum vs
    where
        (as, [m]:ys) = splitAt n xs
        g = nlist2graph n $ map (map (subtract 1)) ys
        iss = filter f . permutations $ [0..n-1]
        f is = and $ zipWith (\a b ->Set.notMember b (g Map.! a)) is (tail is)
        vs = map h iss
        h is = sum $ zipWith (\i j -> (as!!i)!!j) is [0..]
